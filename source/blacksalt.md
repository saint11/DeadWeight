This section of the book is still a work in progress, lots more content will come soon!{.alert}

This book is about the setting of **Dead Weight**,  **Blacksalt Island**. It's also possible to play **Dead Weight** using other settings if you want, but the rules are not generic, and will work better on dark settings with underpowered and desperate characters.

This book is also full of reference tables including equipment, class backgrounds and more. Ideally the players should have easy access to this.

# Equipment {.wide}
![](images/weapons.png "Weapons"){.left .web}

There are 5 item categories **common**, **uncommon**, **valuable**, **rare** and **exotic**. The categories set the item price and how hard it is to find during the **interlude**.

Again, if you really like statistics, this is the statistics map of the [possible prices](https://anydice.com/program/222fe).

# The Dead Vigil
One of the most notable things about **Blacksalt** is the **dead vigil**. Any creature that dies in **Blacksalt** has a chance to come back to life as an undead, humans will almost always come back, animals and other smaller creatures can come back to life but that's not common. This effect is called the **dead vigil**.

The cause of the **dead vigil** is uncertain, some blame the old king for trying to achieve eternal life, others say it's because of something buried deep in the island tunnels, but no one knows for sure.

Any corpse, if left undisturbed, will come back to life after 1d6 weeks as a [Freshly risen corpse]{.m} or [Reanimated husk]{.m}, depending on the state of conservation and will start looking for other people to attack. If the corpse is too damaged or somehow unsuitable, it may come back as ghost, like a [shadow]{.m}; that's rare though, and ghosts are extremely dangerous, so people avoid destroying corpses.

The most "elegant" way to dispose of a body is a proper burial ritual, and a coffin with the seal of [Cador](#cador), which will stop the corpse from returning. This is a relatively new technique. Over the years, people didn't know how to deal with their dead. Different groups of people tried many different rituals and techniques to stop their dead from coming back, usually with horrible consequences.

# Schools of Magic

## Time in spell descriptions
When a spell mentions **turns** without specifying if it's an **exploration turn** or **combat turn**, it means that the context should be used. If that spell is cast during combat, it will last that many **combat turns**; if it's cast during exploration, it will last that many **exploration turns**.

When a spell has a duration that explicitly mentions **exploration turns**, it can also be cast in combat, but remember that the whole combat lasts only one exploration turn.

When rolling for duration, unless specified otherwise, the roll is made by the **player** as soon as the spell has been cast.


<pagebreak>

## Necromancers of Yadar {.big}

![](./images/wizard-necromancer.png){.left}

Controlling the dead and the dark forces of the void is the Necromancers of Yadar's specialty. Their techniques are strictly forbidden in most places of the world, but in Blacksalt, no one cares - they will take whatever works.

Tales tell that Yadar is a small island, hidden in the black sea, populated only by the undead, and ruled by three Necromancers. No one knows exactly where the island is, but Yadar disciples are everywhere, spreading the necromancer's teachings to the rest of the world.

While necromancers are not combat focused, their high-utility spells can be used in clever ways to help solve different problems.

If unable to follow the command for any reason, the undead will just stay in place without moving.

## Alchemists of the Golden Ridge {.big}
![](./images/wizard-alchemist.png)

The secret order of the Golden Ridge is focused on transmuting and creating magic potions and artifacts. For centuries they stayed in the Golden Ridge, extracting and transmuting the local fauna and flora, until the news of Blacksalt reached them. The number of supernatural elements in Blacksalt is endlessly valuable to them.

#### Spells {.block .unlisted}

- **Glue**: Creates a strong adhesive that covers something **nearby**. In combat, this locks an enemy in place; they must succeed a **test** and spend one action to get free.
- **Machine spirit**: Fixes a target machine or metal armor. Doesn't work on machines that are too big.
- **Smoke form**: The wizard turns into smoke, and can move around for a few short seconds, or one combat turn (2 actions). The wizard cannot be harmed while in smoke form. If, after moving, the wizard has no space to turn back into human form the wizard will immediately die, while trying to occupy any available space.
- **Silver cannon**: The wizard can use silver coins as a ranged weapon attacking with **INT 3P**. The wizard must spend 1 silver for each shot.
- **Transmute**: 2 actions in combat, 1 exploration turn or free action during camp. The wizard may mix elemental extracts to create tonics. Requires an **alchemic toolkit** and a bottle.

#### Transmuting
Elemental extracts can be found in corpses and monster remains. To get the elemental extract from a corpse, a wizard requires an **alchemic toolkit** and one exploration turn. For each point in intelligence **proficiency** the wizard can get the extract from an extra corpse nearby in that turn. Check the [bestiary](./bestiary.html) for what type of extract an enemy has. If there is nothing on the enemy sheet, that enemy has no viable extract.

A single inventory slot can store two different extracts. You can stack as many extracts of the same type in the same slot as you want.

| Element | Yig  | Grai |
| :-----: | :--- | :--- |
|  Flame  | -1   | +1   |
|  Water  | +1   | -1   |
|  Smoke  | 0    | -1   |
|  Necro  | -1   | 0    |
|   Rot   | 0    | +1   |
|  Ether  | +1   | 0    |
[Elemental Extracts]

To make a potion, the wizard can mix any number of extracts available. Add all from the **Yig** column first, then from the **Grai** column second. The numbers must match one of the recipes.

> A Healing Tonic (2,0) can be made adding water (+1, -1), ether (+1, 0) and rot (0, +1). An alternative would be adding ether (+1, 0) twice.

## Old Gods {.draft}
Old gods are the ones that lived before the creation of the current world. Before this world, there was another one, and some event caused it to be destroyed, while creating the current one. These beings are so powerful that they didn't fade when their world was destroyed.

Not much is known of them and their worship is strictly forbidden in most cultures, but secret cults can be found all over **Blacksalt** island nonetheless.

# History

## Origins

**Blacksalt** is an ancient island, found more than a thousand years ago by several lost sea travelers. The island apparently had risen from the ocean floor by some volcanic activity and was covered in a thick layer of black salt and algae. Ancient traces of an underwater civilization were found there, intriguing the people from the main continent, but it was the island's rich mineral resources and fertile land that paved the way for fast colonization.

The island was lawless, and many different groups started settling there. Castles and strongholds were built and conflict between the different settlements began as soon as they met. The conflict proved extremely expensive to everyone involved and the **Treaty of Yoros** was created, dividing Blacksalt between different **kingdoms** that would stay in their territory.

This fleeting peace allowed major infrastructure to be built and trade routes to be created.

## The fall

Then suddenly the first antediluvian catacomb was found, changing everything. Down in those caves the kings and queens would cohort with ancient beings giving them extraordinary powers, and they didn't want to share. Aided by the ancient beings' magic, the war between settlements raged on, devastating the land, creating famine, supernatural plagues and eventually the infamous [dead vigil]{.tip} would strike. No one knows who or what caused it, but suddenly the dead started to come back to life hunting down the living. In the current state of the island the dead were by far a majority.

Not much was left of the old kingdoms, only small fortified settlements, castles haunted by the undead and isolated hamlets. This caused **Blacksalt** to be mostly abandoned and forgotten.

## Renaissance

Centuries later, the hordes of the undead had dispersed, and most of the tales of Blacksalt kingdoms forgotten. Pirates re-discovered the island and started trading with the few that were still living there. As soon as the ancient artifacts were found news spread fast.

This coincided with a major war happening in the main continent, where a gigantic military and political unity known simply as **The Empire** started dominating every kingdom it could reach. To win this war, magical artifacts were necessary and the Empire financed expeditions to **Blacksalt** and payed high prices for anything found. This "gold rush" was intense and fast, and several settlements were rebuilt in a few months - most notably **Yoros**, the biggest port-city of **Blacksalt**.

# Geography

Blacksalt is a large island in the southern hemisphere of the planet. The climate is warm in the north and gets wet and cold in the south.

The terrain is mostly flat and near the sea level in the in the north, while mountainous and rocky in the south.

The northeast part of Blacksalt is colloquially known as Yoros Island, while techinically being part of Blacksalt, Yoros river separates most of it from the rest.

On the east part there are five smaller islands closing the Kumar Bay, with Saint Julien Isle being the biggest and the only one populated.

<pagebreak>

### Yoros
**Settlement size: City (5)**

A major port city in **Blacksalt**. Famous for its high quality wine.

Yoros is bursting with commerce and is the main connection between the main continent and Blacksalt. The Emperor is the official ruler of Yoros, but the empire's influence is very limited in Blacksalt, with the **Guild of Commerce** having all the real power.

### Kumar Port City
**Settlement size: City (5)**

A big port city that services the Kumar Bay. The official use of this port is to transport large goods to Yoros, but, in actuality, Kumar is the center of a huge smuggling network, sending magical items to the highest bidder.

The city is in a swamp area rich in natural oil, and since they don't have a lot of available farmland, most of their food comes from ships or from Brutburg.

### Steinsburg
**Settlement size: Stronghold (4)**

A stronghold that once held the undead march centuries ago, Steinsburg is nowhere near its former glory, but is still a sight to behold. The stone stronghold is built on the mountains and its huge walls are still impenetrable.

The people there still live under strict military tradition and are always alert for any undead threat.

### Brutburg
**Settlement size: Stronghold (4)**

A military stronghold in the cold south. Once a noble house that fought valiantly against the undead during the first dead vigil, now decadent and ruined.

Somehow, the farmers of Brutburg manage to plant even in the harsh cold; some say the food of Brutburg is grown using abominable rituals.

### Trinta
**Settlement size: Fief (3)**

A fief ruled by the tyrant lord Ishnar Zul, descendant of a long line of lords from the early days of the exploration of **Blacksalt**. Trinta has huge farmlands and lots of cattle, being responsible for most of the island food production.

The [sample dungeon](./dungeon/dungeon_level_1.html) takes place in Trinta.

### Luna
**Settlement size: Fief (3)**

A farming fief, isolated from most commercial routes, Luna is a somewhat peaceful settlement in the cold plains. Luna was once a military stronghold, but that fortress is long abandoned.

The people of Luna avoid going near the stronghold, and local stories tell of people disappearing inside.

Luna is uncomfortably close to Fallen Agnar, but has never been attacked by the undead from there. Some whisper of a mysterious pact between them.

### Cefit
**Settlement size: Hamlet (2)**

A small trading post set in the middle of the road between Brutburg and Kumar Port-City. Cefit consists of a small inn, a few farmers and shops. The people that live here are mostly recluses and prefer to stay out of outsider's business.


## Fallen Agnar

Agnar was specially hit by the [dead vigil]{.tip} centuries ago, being completely destroyed. It quickly became the central point from where the undead hordes came. Organized undead marched down to Brutburg and Yoros, spawning Tales of a powerful necromancer lich controlling the hordes. Those tales were never confirmed, though.

Today, Agnar is the haunted remains of a city, where not even the bravest explorers dare to venture.
