# Welcome

**Dead Weight** takes place in a low-fantasy world - it's very grim and dark but doesn't take itself too seriously. But be advised that **Dead Weight** has some **horror** elements, and may not be suitable for everyone.

The player characters are no heroes; they are *dead weights* - outcasts and treasure hunters with little to lose. They delve deep into long forsaken places, struggling not only with the horrors that lurk there, but also their fatigue, stress, and the gradual decay of the few resources they bring. All in hopes to save enough silver to leave *Blacksalt Island* for better days elsewhere.

This system has a strong **structure** to it - focusing on **light roleplay** and on dungeon crawling. **Light roleplay** doesn't mean there's no support for it - quite the contrary - it's just that the game system should be fun even if your group doesn't like to roleplay a lot.


## Blacksalt Island {.unlisted}

![](images/weaver.png "a knight dying in a dungeon"){.left .web}

This game takes place in **Blacksalt Island**, and it's a dreadful place. A once-great kingdom, **Blacksalt Island** has been ruined by famine, war and plague long, long ago. When things were already dire, the [dead vigil]{.tip} started. No one knows exactly why, but every single human that dies in the island rises up as a hungry undead. The island was mostly abandoned for many years, but was recently rediscovered. Treasures and arcane relics found in the tombs sparked a "gold rush" of sorts, with people far and wide venturing there to earn some silver.

Now, the island is divided into dungeoneering guilds, each claiming rights to raid certain ruins. They allow adventurers to explore them and even assist them with supplies, as long as they receive a cut of any treasure found.

**Blacksalt Island** is a big place, with multiple cities on the shore, hastily built for this exploration venture and a few villages in its core. Of the original inhabitants, very few are left, but some fiefs and hamlets still date back to the time of the old kings.

The ruins are filled with the undead, and the newcomers seem to only add to their numbers. Humanoid creatures also live there, mostly hidden in the shadows and in the forests, like the [child stealing](#the-child-stealers) goblins and the grotesque gnolls.

Unlike many fantasy worlds, your character is no hero. Quite the contrary, you are someone at the end of the line. Maybe your days of glory are long gone and mostly likely they never came. In one way or another, you don't have much to lose - and that's what brings most people to **Blacksalt Island**.

You arrived at the island hoping to find something - maybe treasure, maybe some lost artifact, maybe a glorious death.

## What you will need  {.unlisted}

**Dead Weight** is designed with both online and offline play in mind. This rule book has links and a structure optimized for reading online and on mobile, so it's easily accessible to all players. This game is best played with 4 players but you can play with more or fewer depending on your play style. The system is also designed to be **roleplay light**, meaning it will be fun even without heavy roleplaying, but, if your group likes to roleplay, it also supports that, adding a whole new layer to the game.

For simplicity, the rules are broken up in different books:
- [Core Rules](./index.html): This book covers all the important rules and basic information on how to play and create characters.
- [Bestiary](./bestiary.html): A list of monsters and enemies for the **adventurers** and their respective stats and lore.
- [Blacksalt](./blacksalt.html): A lore guide about the island and the world of **Blacksalt**, gods, settlements and locations.
- [Quick Reference](./quick-ref.html): A compilation of the most used tables. It's useful to have this open on your phone or on a different tab while playing.
- [Sample Dungeon](./dungeon/dungeon_level_1.html): **Players should NOT read this**, only the **GM**. A sample dungeon for a first adventure.

If you've never played a tabletop RPG before, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_v3vTAEML0) video for a basic explanation. {.web}

**For online play you will need:**

- Some voice and text chatting software like [Discord](https://discord.com) or similar.
- A robust online dice rolling software that allows rerolling, like [Dead Dice](https://deaddice.page/), a dice rolling app I made just for this system. Dead Dice also automates the player's character sheet.
- A virtual tabletop, the simpler the better. I highly recommend [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/). 
- A copy of the character sheet for each player, digital or printed, as the player wishes.

**For playing offline you will need:**

- **You can get a print-optimized version of this page too. We provide in two formats [A4](book-a4.html) and [Letter](book-letter.html).** (work in progress) {.web}
- Pen and paper for everyone.
- A copy of the character sheet for each player, digital or printed, as the player wishes. For digital, the players may use [Dead Dice](https://deaddice.page/) on their phones.
- As many 6-sided die as you can find - ideally 3 per player. Can be played with fewer dice, but it slows the game down. Alternatively, the players may use [Dead Dice](https://deaddice.page/) on their phones.
- A set of RPG dice with a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20. These are not used very often, so a mobile app can do the job if you don't have these.
- Coins, beans, or anything that can be used as tokens. There are 3 types of tokens: **stun**, **shield** and **dodge**.
- Miniatures or some kind of pawns. Each player will require one and the GM will require some for the enemies. They should be easily identifiable.


## About {.print .unlisted .break}

The goal of **Dead Weight** is to capture the classic feeling of dungeon crawling tabletop RPGs and board games. It is inspired by many others, borrowing a lot from Blades in the Dark, HeroQuest (the board game), Forbidden Lands, Knave, The Black Hack and Torchbearer.

This system is open source(https://github.com/saint11/DeadWeight) and is released under the Creative Commons Attribution license: you are free to hack, copy, change and even sell works derivative from this system, as long you give proper attribution. The **Dead Weight** logo cannot be used without express permission, though.

This game was designed and illustrated by me, Pedro Medeiros.

# The Basics
Let's go over the basics of the system. After that, I recommend that you try to create your first character.

### Game Master {.unlisted}
One of the players is the **game master**, which in this book will be abbreviated as **GM**. The *GM* is like a narrator and plays all the non-player characters, guides the outcomes of the player actions and creates the details of the world.

The game master has the [game master sheet](DeadWeight-master-sheet.pdf), just like the players. {.draft}

### Players {.unlisted}
Everyone else is considered a **player**. Players each have a **character** that they roleplay; they will choose the actions of that character and try to keep them alive and move towards that character's *objectives*.

### Adventurers {.unlisted}
**Characters** in **Dead Weight** are people who either lost everything or didn't ever had anything to begin with - misfit adventurers willing to risk going into the deep vaults of **Blacksalt Island** to find precious treasures and artifacts while risking their lives and their sanity. There are no heroes in **Blacksalt Island**.

Characters will *level up* between expeditions and eventually retire, if everything goes well. Characters can also find an untimely end by something horrible in the depths of the island.

In this book, we will often say **adventurers** when referring specifically to player characters.

### Game Session {.unlisted}

This game played in **sessions**, which can last at least one hour and up to four hours - it depends on the play style of your group. Each game session is structured in 2 distinct states: the **expedition** and the **interlude** - delving into a terrible place or recovering and making plans for the next expedition. The players may choose from a list of actions depending on the current game phase. Depending on how much roleplay your group likes, the interlude phase may be simplified or not.

### Ok, how do I start? {.unlisted}
First, decide who will be the **game master** and who are going to be the **players**. The game master should ideally read this whole rule book, including the **sample dungeon** in the end. It is recommended that the players read at least the [Core Mechanics](#core-mechanics) after creating the characters, but it's not required. Players should **not** read the **sample dungeon**, or they will spoil the adventure.

Then, each player should create a **character**; follow the [Character Creation](#character-creation) chapter for more information.

::: {.draft}
The **GM** should also fill the [game master sheet](DeadWeight-master-sheet.pdf) to set the tone of the world.
At the end of this book, there's a sample dungeon to help the **GM** get started. The **players** should **not** read that section.
:::

After that, the adventure starts! It is recommended to start on the **expedition**, with the **adventurers** right outside the dungeon entrance, choosing how they will enter. If you want, you can also start in a village, or city - it's entirely up to you.

<pagebreak>


# Character Creation

![](images/boat.png "A boat in a dark sea"){.left}

Let's start by creating your character - don't worry too much about the rule system for now, just follow the steps from this chapter and choose what you think sounds most exciting. If you really want to know the rules before doing this, you can skip ahead and come back after you've learned the rules.

Every character starts their life with **1 insight point**, which they can use to re-roll one or both dice of a life path roll. Some life paths will give you more insight, and later in the game, insight will be used to level up your character. When playing with a group, if your character has the same **life path** as another character in your party, each player may, only once, roll again without spending insight.

When you complete the last step of your character, you can immediately spend any insight you have left, without even placing it on the character sheet. That is recommended, since you can only earn a limited amount of insight during the whole lifetime of your character. You can see how to spend insight in the [playing the game](./game.html#character-progression) book.

Each step will add and remove **attribute points**, **equipment**, and other things to your character. Place them in the appropriate place in your character sheet. 

If you get the same skill twice, upgrade it instead. Feel free to jump ahead to the [skills](#skills), [traits](#special-traits) and [equipment](./blacksalt.html#equipment) section to understand what they do.

Print a [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf) or use [Dead Dice](https://deaddice.page/) if you want a digital sheet and let's start! Alternatively, you can also try the [character generator](chargen.html) for an automatic character.

**Adventurers** have 4 main attributes. They are noted in the [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf):

- **Strength**(STR) is physical strength and constitution of a character.
- **Dexterity**(DEX) is how fast and precise a character is.
- **Intelligence**(INT) is how intelligent, wise and keen a character is
- **Presence**(PRE) is how persuasive and strong-willed a character is.

Each attribute has 2 values, **score** and **proficiency**. The former is the natural ability and endurance with the attribute, the latter is how well-trained the **adventurer** is in that particular field. In the [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf), the square area is for the **score** and the circle is for the **proficiency**.

All **attributes scores** start at 1, while all **attribute proficiencies** start at zero.

**Attributes scores** can **not** go lower than 0 or higher than 3 at any point in character creation - ignore any excess points.

**Attribute proficiencies** can **not** go lower than 0 or higher than 2 at any point in character creation - ignore any excess points.

By default, characters start with a **belt**, **canteen** and a **bag**. You also have a few starting items:
- 1d6 torches
- 1 ration
- On 3d! ([Risk dice](#risk-dice-1d)), 1 camping supply
- On 2d!, 1 bandage
- Your class's start items. See [Choose your class](#6-choose-your-class) below.

If no one got a camping supply, someone in the group may receive one.

## 4. Roll your burden
No one comes to the *Blacksalt Isle* unburdened. Your burden guides your character actions, usually causing problems and complications.

Once per session, you may use your burden to make your character's life harder. Taking a decision that will impact you negatively or when making a test at a crucial point, you can choose to make that test with disadvantage and no proficiency, explaining why your burden made it harder for you. If you do any of these, you earn an **insight point**. Read more about insight in the [character progression](./game.html#character-progression) chapter in the [playing the game](./game.html) book.

| :---: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   2   | **Naive dreams of glory**: The world needs a hero. Since no-one ever volunteers, you often do.                    |
|   3   | **Fear of loss**: You already lost enough and will do what you need to keep the few things you have.              |
|   4   | **Reckless**: *Blacksalt* can be a fresh start or a quick end.                                                    |
|   5   | **Martyr**: Always volunteer for taking risks for others.                                                         |
|   6   | **Fame and riches**: You want out of this life - you want a better life. You need it.                             |
|   7   | **Restless**: Never wants to stop, always wants to press on.                                                      |
|   8   | **Redemption**: You can no longer live with the things you've done; maybe you can redeem yourself in *Blacksalt*. |
|   9   | **Zealous Fury**: *Blacksalt* must be cleansed of any diabolical presence, no matter the cost.                    |
|  10   | **Amnesia**: You don't know how you got here, you just woke up here one day; you are often confused.              |
|  11   | **An Heir**: Your family is waiting for you: you will come back for them - they are counting on you.              |
|  12   | **A Soul Sold**: You are going to hell, and you know it. Do your actions even matter now?                         |

## 5. Roll your features

This is a strong aspect that your character has. Besides the advantages and disadvantages that these characteristics will give you, this will help you to roleplay and imagine how your character acts and looks. These are not the only features of you character - you are encouraged to create more. If you and the *GM* agree, you can choose this instead of rolling.

You may write this down in the notes section of your character sheet.

|  12   | You are very clean and tidy. Something most people in Blacksalt aren't.                                                                                      |

## 6. Choose your class

Classes will give special skills to your character. Choose one and follow the instructions for each class. After that, your character is done!

There are 4 main classes. Each class has a specific **background** that you must also choose. They are all in the [Blacksalt book](./blacksalt.html).

Check the **skills** and **traits** section to understand what each of your traits and skills do. Make sure to also check how your **equipment** works on the **equipment and items** section. You may also spend your gold on equipment and items before the mission starts, but you may **not** sell items before the first mission.

<pagebreak>

### Warrior {.big}

![](images/warrior-footman.png "Warrior with the footman background"){.wide}

- [Gladiator](./blacksalt.html#gladiator)
- [Barbarian](./blacksalt.html#barbarian)

<pagebreak>

### Wizard {.big}

![](images/wizard-alchemist.png "Wizard with the alchemist background")

- Add 1 proficiency point to **Intelligence**.
- Add the trait **magic user**.
- Add skill **lore master**.
- Wizards can use only small, one-handed weapons, staves and light armor.

#### School of magic

Choose one of the following as your [school of magic](./blacksalt.html#schools-of-magic):

  - [Necromancers of Yadar](./blacksalt.html#necromancers-of-yadar)
  - [Alchemists of the Golden Ridge](./blacksalt.html#alchemists-of-the-golden-ridge)
  - [Thaumaturgists of Ravenhome](./blacksalt.html#thaumaturgists-of-ravenhome)
  - [Wandering Mystics](./blacksalt.html#wandering-mystics)
  - [The Awakened](./blacksalt.html#the-awakened)

You can choose a different conductor or grimoire, if the *GM* allows it.

#### Spells

Wizards must choose a number of **spells** equal to their **intelligence score** from the spell list from their school of magic. Check the [Blacksalt book](./blacksalt.html#schools-of-magic) for that list. Write them down on your character sheet under the "spells and prayers" section.

Wizards require a **conductor** to perform their spells, usually a wand, staff or crystal ball. Conductors help them to channel the magic from the *void plane* to the real world. While casting a spell without a conductor is possible, it's extremely dangerous. When casting without a conductor, any **failure** counts as a **critical failure**.

Wizards also need a **grimoire** to store their spells; without a grimoire, they can't study during the **interlude** or **camp** phase to remember forgotten spells. In some cases, the grimoire and the conductor are the same.

When the expedition starts, the player must choose which spells the adventurer will have memorized. One spell can be memorized for each **intelligence** point.

Casting a spell is always guaranteed to work: after the spell effects are resolved, the **player** must do an **intelligence** test:

- On a **success**, nothing else happens. The spell was cast as intended.
- On a **failure**, the caster forgets the spell.
- On a **critical failure**, roll from the spell mishap table. Keep track of how many mishaps have occurred during this expedition. Add that number to the dice total.
- On a **great success**, you tap into an arcane well. Your next spell will be an automatic success.

| 3d6 + Previous mishaps | Effect                                                                                                       |

|           6            | You see a world without you, and it's better. You now have the **Shaken** affliction.                        |

|           8            | Everyone **Nearby** receives the **Angry** affliction; you receive the **Terrified** affliction.             |
|           9            | Everyone **Nearby** starts crying and receives the **Hopeless** affliction.                                  |
|           10           | You and everyone **Close** have terrible visions and receive the **Terrified** affliction.                   |
|           11           | Summon a *void demon* **Close** to you.                                                                      |
|           12           | You start bleeding from your eyes; take **1 wound** to each attribute and the **Bleeding** affliction.       |

|           14           | You see a giant eye looking at you. Receive the **Doomed** affliction.                                       |
|           15           | Summon a *tormentor demon* **Close** to you.                                                                 |
|           16           | A third eye opens in your forehead; you are **Cursed**. This does not count as the Third Eye special trait.  |
|           17           | You quickly teleport to the *void realm* and back, but all your equipment and items stay there.              |
|           18           | Summon an *endless horror* **Nearby**.                                                                       |

### Cleric {.big .break}

![](images/cleric-yulak.png "Cleric of Yulak")

- Add 1 proficiency point to **Presence**.
- Add the trait **divine mandate**.
- Add skill **ward the dead**.
- Clerics can only use one-handed weapons, staves, bows, crossbows and medium armor

#### Gods
Choose one of the following [gods](./blacksalt.html#gods) for you to follow. That will determine your starting equipment and spells:
- [Goshkalon](./blacksalt.html#goshkalon)
- [Cador](./blacksalt.html#cador)
- [Yulak](./blacksalt.html#yulak)
- [Akhzu](./blacksalt.html#akhzu)
- [Kaal Rafir](./blacksalt.html#kaal-rafir)

Clerics must choose a god to follow; you can see the list of gods in the [Blacksalt book](./blacksalt.html#gods). Clerics must also choose a number of prayers equal to their **presence score** from the [basic prayers list](#basic-prayers) or from their god's prayers. Write them down in your character sheet under the "spells and prayers" section.

#### Prayers
Clerics require a **holy symbol** to cast a prayer; that symbol depends on the god that the cleric follows. Casting a prayer without a holy symbol doesn't work, but they are usually easy to improvise.

When the expedition starts, a player must choose which prayers the adventurer will have memorized. One prayer can be memorized for each **presence** point. Each prayer may only be used **once** until the adventurer **rests** at camp: once a prayer is used, it is considered to be **exhausted**. Once per expedition, the cleric may do a **desperate plea** and use an exhausted prayer once.

Casting a prayer is not guaranteed to work, since the gods can be cruel sometimes. Make a **presence test** when your adventurer tries to cast a **prayer**:

- On a **success**, the prayer is answered; resolve the effects as usual.
- On a **failure**, the prayer is ignored; don't do anything. Ignored prayers do not exhaust them.

# Core mechanics

## Game Structure
A game of **Dead Weight** runs a bit differently than most tabletop RPGs. It follows a strong structure, with two main states.

- [Expedition](#expedition-phase)
- [Interlude](#interlude)

The game usually starts in the **Expedition** phase, with the adventurers raiding a dungeon or some other terrible place in the **Blacksalt Isle**.

## Dice Notation
Like many tabletop RPGs, **Dead Weight** uses dice notation to specify when and how you should roll your dice. Most die rolls are common six-sided dice, unless specified otherwise.

When you see **d4**, **d6**, **d8**, **d10**, **d12** and **d20**, this is referring to a die of that size; d4 is a four-sided die and d20 is a twenty-sided die. Let's review all styles of dice notations we will use in this book:

### Adding dice (2d6) {.unlisted}
When you see **3d6**, that means roll **three six-sided dice** and add the result.

### Usage dice (Ud8) {.unlisted}
Usage dice track consumable use. For instance, **Throwing Daggers (Ud8)** have a d8 usage die. Every time the consumable is used, the usage dice are rolled: if the result is a 1 or 2, that die is downgraded to the next smallest value in the following chain:

**d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4**

If you roll a 1 or 2 on a **d4**, that item is gone: you just used the last one.

### Risk dice (1d!) {.unlisted}
Risk die are usually for checking if something unpredictable will happen. Roll the indicated number of **d6**; if any show a 1, that thing happens.

## Attribute Tests and Checks

Rolling dice in Dead Weight is a dangerous and strategic activity. In general, players want to get away with actions that do **not** involve testing. Testing is usually  **exhausting** for the characters, and in the dungeons, fatigue is deadlier than most blades. The **GM** may ask you to perform a test when your character tries to do something difficult, uncertain and has consequences.

Rolling dice also involves decision making: carefully choosing which dice to reroll is an important part of the game and helps your character to take difficult actions with different approaches.

Testing is always done in relation to a character's attribute. For example, trying to break down a door would require a **test of *strength***. To do so, players must roll the same amount of dice as the score of the tested attribute. A character with a **strength** of 3 would have 3 ***available dice*** for a ***strength test***. Players may always choose to roll fewer dice, or to not roll at all, failing the test.

The player needs to roll a **4, 5 or 6** on at least one die to complete the task successfully. If the player rolls more than one **6** on the dice, that's an great success and things go exceptionally well for that character. On the other side, if the player fails and rolls one or more **1** on the dice, that's a critical failure and things go exceptionally poorly for that character. 6s override 1s.

> <d6 v=4> <d6 v=2> <d6 v=1> A successful roll example.

> <d6 v=3> <d6 v=2> A failed roll example.

Beware that if **any** of the rolled dice is **4** or **1**, the player will receive one fatigue point to that attribute, and only one, even if the test succeeded.

> <d6 v=4> <d6 v=2> A success, but with a fatigue cost.

> <d6 v=6> <d6 v=1> Another success, also with a fatigue cost.

> <d6 v=3> <d6 v=1> A fail roll that also has a fatigue cost.

Rerolling dice is a common thing in **Dead Weight**. Many things, like character skills and dangerous situations will allow the *players* and the *GM* to reroll certain dice. The order of rerolls is always dynamic: *players* may choose to use their rerolls one by one, react to the *GM* rerolls and vice-versa. **The test is only evaluated when both sides can't, or agree not to, reroll any more dice.**

<pagebreak>

Here is an example of an attribute test:

> Amber wants to climb down a rope, so the GM says that she will require a **dexterity test**. She has a **dexterity score** of 4, and she decides to roll all 4 dice.
> 
> She rolls <d6 v=1><d6 v=2><d6 v=4><d6 v=6>
> 
> Since she rolled a 6, the test is a **success**. She manages to climb down the rope safely. Unfortunately for Amber, she also rolled a 1 and a 4; since that happened, she should receive one **fatigue point** to her **dexterity**.

If you are really into statistics, you can check the chance of critical failure, failure, success and great success [here](https://anydice.com/program/21d88) and the chance of fatigue [here](https://anydice.com/program/21e52).

### Wounds and fatigue

Every time a character receives **fatigue** points, apply them to an attribute.

Each **fatigue** or **wound** point that the character has on that attribute reduces the **available dice** of that attribute by one.

If a character needs to receive a **fatigue** point and that would make the **available dice** of that attribute lower than zero, convert one *fatigue* into a **wound** to that attribute; that **wound** can **not** be reduced by armor and other resistances. Read *Receiving Wounds* for more information.

### Proficiency
Players may reroll a number of dice if they have proficiency on that **attribute**. For example a character with 2 points in **intelligence** **proficiency** can reroll 2 dice when testing for **intelligence**. Players may choose to use their proficiency dice one at the time.

If you choose to reroll a dice, you **must** use the new result, even if it's worse in any way.

Having a high attribute score is always good, but having proficiency is where things get interesting in **Dead Weight**. The rerolls usually make for interesting and difficult decisions.

### Keeping it Safe

If the player doesn't want to risk fatigue, they can reduce their roll by **2 dice**. If they do, rolling 1 or 4 will no longer exhaust the attribute, unless the test fails. This must be announced before the dice are rolled. You cannot use extra effort when you are keeping it safe.

![](images/helper.png "hand grabbing someone else's arm"){.left}

### Receiving Help

Characters can help each other with a task, if they choose to do so. The player must explain how their character is helping the other in a way that makes sense for the action. The **GM** and the rest of the table must agree that the situation is plausible. This must be announced before the dice are rolled.

A character can only receive the help from one other character, unless the **GM** specifies otherwise. The helping character should roll one die; that dice will contribute to the main roll. If the helping character has a **proficiency** on that attribute, they can use it to reroll that dice. The character performing the main roll may (not?) change that dice in any way.

Note that any **fatigue** generated by that dice should be received by the helping character only.

Negative consequences of a failed task are also suffered by the helping character, where applicable, but not the **fatigue** rolled by the main character.

### Extra Effort

If the player really wants to succeed, it is possible to add one more dice to the ***available dice*** pool by causing the character one **fatigue** point before the roll, as long the player announces that **before** rolling the dice. A character cannot spend **fatigue** if it would cause the character to receive a wound as consequence of doing so.

Players may (not?) use extra effort after rolling the dice.

<pagebreak>

If the player is already going for the **extra effort**, rolling a 1 or a 4 will not cause **fatigue**, since they are already receiving that point.

Helping characters can also use the ***extra effort*** rule, rolling two dice instead of one, as long as they announce that before rolling.

### Zero Dice?

If, for any reason, you need to roll zero dice, you should roll 2 die instead and take the lowest number instead. Rolling less than zero dice is also possible: roll 2 die and add one extra dice for each value below zero. For instance, when rolling -3 die, roll 5 die (2+3) and choose the worst. I'm pretty sure that test will fail, though, sorry.

For simplicity, the *GM* may declare a -2 or lower roll to be an automatic failure.

### Checks or Tests

Sometimes a rule will call for a **check**, such as an initiative check. Checks work exactly like tests, except that rolling 1s and 4s on this test do **not** cause fatigue.

Proficiency can be used normally in **checks**.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a test describes an especially easy or difficult action, the **GM** may give players an **advantage** or **disadvantage**. Many combat actions and enemy abilities will also add an **advantage** or **disadvantage** to tests.

- **Advantage** allows the player to choose **one** die from the test or check to reroll. The new value must be used.
- **Disadvantage** allows the *GM* to choose **one** die from the test or check to reroll. The new value must be used.

The players or *GM* may always choose *not* to reroll a dice for advantage or disadvantage, respectively.

**Advantage** and **disadvantage** will nullify each other if for any reason a test would have both; they can also stack: having **advantage** or **disadvantage** multiple times allows the players or *GM* to reroll multiple dice.

The *GM* must announce that the test has **advantage** and/or **disadvantage** before the dice have been rolled.

## Receiving Wounds

Characters will often receive wounds from various sources. Most wounds can be reduced, usually by **armor** or some character traits. Wounds received by **fatigue** cannot be reduced.

### Armor {.unlisted}

Making an armor roll is a bit different than making a test.

If your character has armor, it will have a number of **armor points**, abbreviated as **AP**.

To use armor, roll one dice per **armor point**: for each **4, 5, or 6** reduce the damage by one. For each **1** or **4** rolled, that armor takes damage and will lose 1 armor point until it's repaired. Players may always choose to roll fewer or zero armor dice.

If the **adventurer** is wearing multiple pieces of armor, like a *helmet* and a *vest*, only one piece of armor can be used to defend each attack. The player chooses which piece to use.

Some armors are notated like this `2, 2 AP` with 2 or more numbers. This means that each "part" of the armor should be used individually. In the example armor, the player may not roll 4 dice at the same time, only 2. Those parts break individually, too.

>Zael just received  **2 wounds** from an arrow and decides to use his **reinforced leather armor (2 armor points)** to 2 dice. The new results are 1 and 6, which reduces the damage to only **1 wound**, but the armor is damaged and now has only 1 armor point until it's repaired.

### Placing wounds {.unlisted}

When receiving **wounds**, you must choose one or more attributes on which to place them. If an attribute already has **fatigue** points, you may convert those to wounds instead of adding wounds when placing each point.

>Zael now just received **3 wounds** from an sword attack and managed to reduce it to **2 wounds** using **armor**. After some consideration, he decides to place that damage on the **presence** attribute, which already had 2 fatigue; that fatigue is now converted to wounds.

Attributes can't hold more wounds than their **score**.

Sometimes a rule will force the player to place the wounds on a specific attribute. If the specified attribute can't hold that many wounds, ignore the excess and the character will immediately collapse and [faint](#fainting). A common example for this is when receiving fatigue on an attribute that's already filled with wounds; this would make the character break down from exhaustion.

If no attribute can hold any more **wounds**, meaning that all available dice have been reduced to zero, and another wound must be placed, that **character** gets **mortally wounded**. Most wounds are considered **lethal**, but sometimes a character will receive a **non-lethal wound**. When that happens, a character will not be **mortally wounded** when receiving that damage; all excess points should be discarded and the character just [faints](#fainting).

**Mortally wounded characters** donâ€™t die immediately, but they cannot take any actions and must be **stabilized** by someone after the combat. If a mortally wounded character receives any more damage, that character will die.

**Enemies** don't have attributes, so there's no need to choose where to place the wounds when receiving them. Enemies die when receive more wounds than noted in their enemy sheet.

If the received wounds are reduced to zero or less by armor or other resistances, that character doesn't take any wounds.

<pagebreak>

## Fainting
When a character would receive a fatigue or would point but it is impossible to place it, they immediately **faint**. Then, the character cannot move or take any actions. Wounds continue to be placed as normal.

Keep track of how many wounds were discarded when you fainted. You stay fainted for at least that amount of turns (combat or exploration turns). Discard all stun tokens while in this state. After waiting you may roll 1D! to try waking up by yourself.

Outside of combat other characters can stabilize you with a **first aid kit, medical supply or healing spell** and wake you up.

## Mortal Wounds
When a player character is **mortally wounded**, that player must roll from the mortally wounded table.
- Add 1 to the dice result for each time the character was mortally wounded during this [Expedition](#expedition-phase).
- Other game effects can also add or subtract from that value.

A mortally wounded character is unable to move or perform any actions. That character must be stabilized with a **first aid kit**, **medical supply** or **healing spell** to wake up. If your character already has the trauma you would receive, ignore it.

|  1d6  | Effect                                                                                            |

|   2   | This injury won't heal how it should. Receive the **chronic pain** [trauma](#traumas).            |
|   3   | Choose and receive a [trauma](#traumas) you don't currently have.                                 |
|   4   | You bleed internally. Receive the **brain damage** [trauma](#traumas).                            |
|   5   | You see the other side. Receive the **visions** [trauma](#traumas).                               |
|   6   | On the verge of death! If not stabilized in 1 combat turn, you are dead. No lasting consequences. |
|  7+   | You are **dead**.                                                                             |

{.roll meta-dice=1 meta-values="0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7"}

## Special Tests {.break}
There are some particular cases where attribute tests won't work. Let's see some solutions to those problems.

### Player opposing tests
What happens if there's a player versus player situation? In that situation, both players must perform the appropriate attribute test. The attribute is chosen by the *GM*, depending on the situation (an arm wrestling match would require *strength*, a race would use *dexterity*).

If one player succeeds and the other fails, the one that succeeded won. If there's a tie, roll again until only one is victorious.

### Player attacking players
In the rare situation where a player character attacks another, either my mistake or by evil intent, the attacking player must roll a test using the attribute currently notated on the weapon or attack. Alternatively, if the *GM* and players agree, a different attribute that fits the situation better can be rolled, but it's always the attacker that rolls the dice.

### Non-player characters opposing tests and attacks
When a monster, or any character not directly controlled by the player attacks another, you can also run into problems, since they don't have attributes. To solve this, use their level as the attribute score instead.

<pagebreak>

# Core Concepts

## Attributes

Character attributes in **Dead Weight** specify how good your character is at something.

Attributes have two numbers, the **score**, which measures your character endurance and natural talent with that attribute, and the ***proficiency***, measuring how well trained your character is at that attribute. Every character has 4 attributes.

- **Strength** (STR) is physical strength and constitution of a character. It also influences how many ***items*** a character can carry.
- **Dexterity** (DEX) is how fast and precise a character is. It is used mostly in ranged attacks, initiative, dodging and in a variety of tests.
- **Intelligence** (INT) is how intelligent and wise a character is. It also influences how many **spells** a character can memorize.
- **Presence** (PRE) is how persuasive and strong-willed a character is. It also influences how many **prayers** a character can memorize.

Attributes can also have **fatigue** and **wounds**. A good way to write those down in your sheet is to make a single line for fatigue and an "X" for a wound. During combats your character will probably receive and recover fatigue often, so using small markers like coins, beans or a dice might be easier; you can write down your fatigue after the conflict is resolved.

## Skills
Skills mainly give your character extra abilities to use during the **expedition** and **interlude**. But they can also be extremely valuable for gathering information and interacting with the world. With the *loremaster* skill, for example, the *GM* may give you extra information on the dungeon history, or, with the *ritualist* skill, the *GM* might tell you how to remove a curse you received. Skills are a good opportunity for the **GM** and **players** to exercise their creativity while coming up with stories.

Some skills can be upgraded: remove the previous skill before learning the advanced one so it only occupies one slot. They are the indented ones below, for clarity. You must always learn the basic skill before the advanced one.

- **Haggle**: During the **interlude** you can reroll the price of an item once. You must use the new result.
  - **Trade network**: During the **interlude**, you can reroll the price of an item once. You may choose to use the new or the old result. You may also reroll the item **availability** once.
  
<pagebreak>

- **Holy Rites**: You have an extensive knowledge about the new gods, prayers and the saints. You may make holy water using clean water and 1 exploration turn.
- **Infiltration**: Allows the **search for traps** action without proper tools during expeditions and an [advantage]{.tip} when sneaking.
- **Intimidate**: You may perform an **intimidate** action in combat (2 actions), attacking with **PRE 1N** against all **nearby** enemies. Only one intimidate action can be used per combat.
- **Loremaster**: You have an extensive knowledge about the world history, languages and different cultures.
- **Pilfer**: You earn 1d6 silver coins at the start of the **interlude**.

- **Stalker**: Before combat, if undetected by an enemy, you have a free critical hit.
- **Street Wise**: You cannot get robbed in the **interlude**, and you have one extra daily action. You may reduce the price of **common** items by 1 silver (to a minimum of 1).
- **Surgeon**: During the **camp phase**, you may perform an **Intelligence** test to heal one wound from each character in your group.
- **Survivalist**: Gain 1 extra proficiency point for anything that involves surviving in the wilderness. Adds 1 extra camp action.

- **Veteran**: (1 explorer action) Test **presence**: on a success, you will know how much **doom** this location currently has, and how much doom is required to trigger the next step.

![](images/hunter.png "Hunter with a bow"){.left .web}

## Special Traits

Special traits are similar to skills, but usually add or break a rule for your character.

- **Berserker**: During combat, ignore **strength** fatigue and wounds when rolling tests. You still take wounds and fatigue normally, and so your character will collapse in exhaustion if your available dice go lower than zero.
- **Bad omens**: Every time you have a critical fail on a test, advance the **omens** tracker.
- **Battle trance**: Every time you kill an enemy, you get an extra action.

![](images/hunter.png "Hunter with a bow"){.left .print}

- **Cold blood**: You may back-stab enemies that are engaged in combat with another character or distracted, for which you may use **Dexterity** to hit with weapons that would require **Strength**. Enemies can't use **resistance** to reduce your damage, and you cause one extra wound.
- **Divine mandate**: You may cast prayers. You require a holy symbol, and must have previously memorized them. Check the [prayers](#prayers) section for more information.
- **Hardened**: When receiving wounds from an attack, you may test **strength**: on a success, resist **1 wound**. On a [great success]{.tip} resist **2 wounds**.
- **Magic user**: You may invoke spells. You require a magic **conductor**, and must have previously memorized them. Check the [spells](#spells) section for more information.
- **Rejected by death**: If your character would get **mortally wounded**, roll 2d!: if triggered, ignore the mortal wound.
- **Dauntless**: When you get a **success** on a test, you may roll **2 extra dice** and add them to this test. *This increases your great success and fatigue chance*.
- **Third eye**: You can see the **omens** tracker.

<pagebreak>

## Traumas
Traumas work similarly to **special traits**, except that they are always very bad for the **adventurers**. Traumas are usually received when the character gets mortally wounded. Most traumas can be recovered or at least downgraded to a more manageable one.

Receiving the same trauma again has no effect.

- **Broken arm**: Can't use one arm for attacking or carrying items.
- **Broken leg**: Movement reduced to 1 tile and costs 2 actions in combat. Moving during expedition must be done with help or some sort of cane.
- **Chronic pain**: You just can't seem to focus. Reduce one point on one attribute **score** that is not already zero.
- **Brain damage**: Reduce one **proficiency** point on one attribute that is not already zero.
- **Paranoid**: Can't receive help from allies, and can't share items other than rations in the **camp** phase. -1 ambush dice in the **camp** phase.
- **Fearful**: During combat, if you are attacked, you move one tile back. If you are attacked more than once, you get 1 (and only 1) [stun token]{.tip}.
- **Visions**: When someone casts a spell **nearby**, you receive a [stun token]{.tip}.


## Afflictions {.wide}

Each **affliction** has their own set of rules on how they affect the character and how they are removed.
If an **adventurer** would receive an affliction he or she already has, ignore it.

| Afflictions   | Effect                                                                 | Getting rid of *                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hungry**    | Wounds do not heal.                                                    | Eat food.                                                         |
| **Parched**   | Cannot recover fatigue.                                                | Drink water.                                                      |
| **Bleeding**  | Receive one fatigue point every turn.                                  | Use bandages or some other form of first aid.                     |
| **Sleepy**    | Can't use **extra effort** or help friends on tests.                   | Camp or drink coffee, or receive a wound in combat.               |
| **Angry**     | Can't reroll your dice with proficiency.                               | Drink a cup of tea or hot chocolate.                              |
| **Shaken**    | Can't use the **Catch Breath** action in combat or during exploration. | Rest in the camp phase.                                           |
| **Nauseated** | During combat, you have one less action.                               | Some potions and tonics. Healed in the **interlude** phase.       |
| **Terrified** | Rolling a 4 on attribute tests doesn't count as a **success**.         | Drink wine or other alcoholic drink, or defeat a challenging foe. |
| **Hopeless**  | Rolling a 5 or 6 also causes fatigue.                                  | Escaping alive from the dungeon or survive a challenging fight.   |
| **Cursed**    | Wounds do not heal by resting. Can see ghosts.                         | Only removed by magic or miracles.                                |
| **Plagued**   | Coughs constantly. When receiving fatigue, receive a wound instead.    | Only removed by magic or miracles.                                |
| **Doomed**    | When the doom tracker moves, it moves one extra point.                 | Only removed by magic or miracles.                                |

## Inventory
Characters can carry 7 items + 3 items for each **strength score**. Items should be placed on your character sheet in the appropriate slots in the **Trappings** section. While carrying more items is possible, the character will become **encumbered**, and all movement is reduced by half. You must perform a **strength test** every turn, and failing means some item was dropped, chosen randomly.

At the trappings table, on top of each list, there's a label, something like "**Belt/Small pouch**". Circle any items your character has; if your character doesn't have any of the listed items, cross out the whole list.

Here's a breakdown of how the **adventurers** can carry their items:

- A **bag** carried on the back can carry **4 items**; a **backpack** can carry **7 items**.
- A **belt** can carry **1 item**; a **small pouch** can carry **2 items**.
- A **canteen** can carry **1 liquid item**; a **skin** can carry **2 liquid items**.
- Each **small bag** can carry **3 items**.

Unless stated otherwise, all characters start with a **belt**, a **canteen** and a **bag**.

When items have a characteristic that makes them awkward or hard to carry, write it below the item, with the characteristic occupying one extra slot. Examples of characteristics are **oversized**, **fragile** and **unstable**.

Very small items, like chalk, keys or a dice do not occupy any slots, and should be written down in the *notes* section of the character sheet.

Characters may also carry items in their **torso** and **hands** slots.

- The **torso** has 4 slots.
- Each **hand** has 2 slots.

Equipped armor and helmet go on the torso slots; wielded items, including torches, go on the hands. Unless the player has a really good explanation, a character can only wield one item in each hand, even with 2 slots. For simply carrying stuff, carrying 2 items in each hand is fine.

The character's clothes that are not considered armor do not occupy a slot. You can write them down in the notes section.

## Distance
Most weapons, skills, spells and items will have a maximum or minimum range to work. To simplify things, we will use some abbreviations, instead of listing the numbers every time.
There are 4 range types for measuring distance in **Dead Weight**:

**Close**, **Nearby**, **Far** and **Distant**.

When using a grid map, here's how you can convert distances:

| Distance    |    Meters     |        Squares        |
| :---------- | :-----------: | :-------------------: |
| **Close**   |     1.5m      | 1 square, no diagonal |
| **Nearby**  |      9m       |       6 squares       |
| **Far**     |      20m      |      12 squares       |
| **Distant** | more than 20m |      12 squares       |

## Trackers
Also known as a *progress clock* in other systems, a **tracker** is just one or more circles divided into segments that the *GM* uses to track the progression of something. Every time a tracker is advanced, one segment must be filled. When the circle is completely filled, the tracker is triggered and something happens. There are 3 main trackers that are always in play:

- **Decay tracker**: Represents the toll that dungeon delving takes on the **adventurers**. Causes hunger, exhaustion and other bad things to the players. Advances every turn.
- **Doom tracker**: There's one for each dungeon, representing the dungeon "waking up" to the **adventurers**' presence and reacting.
- **Bad Omens tracker**: There's one for the whole campaign. Represents the **adventurers**' terrible luck and their inevitable doom in **Blacksalt island**. Every time it gets completed, something really bad happens.

The [Playing the Game book](./game.html) explains in more detail how each of these trackers work, so don't worry about them for now.

The *GM* can also create more trackers at any moment, to represent long challenges, the tide rising, a strong enemy slowly waking up and so on. Trackers can be hidden from the players or fully visible.

### Light
**Adventurers** often explore tombs, dungeons and other dark places. Having some sort of light source is essential. The most common ways to light the way in a dungeon are:
- **Torches**: Lights the way [nearby]{.tip}, for Ud4 decays.
- **Candles**: Lights the way [close]{.tip}, for Ud6 decays.
- **Lantern**: Lights the way [nearby]{.tip} for Ud8 decays. Uses oil. [Quick]{.tip} to turn on and off, [slow]{.tip} to refuel.
- **Light spell**: Lights the way [nearby]{.tip}, for 1 decay.

Every time a [decay](#decay) happens, the usage dice of the light sources should be tested. If the usage dice is exhausted, the light source will be gone next turn: a new one must be lit next turn or the **adventurers** will be left in the dark.

Ending a turn in the dark causes an **adventurer** to take a **presence** fatigue or the **terrified** affliction, player's choice.

# About {.web}

The goal of **Dead Weight** is to capture the classic feeling of dungeon crawling tabletop RPGs and board games. It is inspired by many others, borrowing a lot from Blades in the Dark, HeroQuest (the board game), Forbidden Lands, Knave, The Black Hack and Torchbearer.
