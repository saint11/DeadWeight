### Demons {.big}
All magic com from the void realm, a nightmare plane where all demons come from.

<monster id="vault_weaver">

Vault weavers are unnatural beings from the void. They are perfectly round balls of faint white light that float around, looking for corpses to consume. A weaver in this state is hungry and will attack anything nearby unless there's a corpse for it to feed. It prefers fresh corpses, so it will try injure and capture its victims for eating one by one when it's hungry.

<monster id="red_weaver">

When a red weaver dies it will explode, launching all the corpses it ate all over the place. May cause 1 wound to anyone nearby. The corpses are usually a bit shrunk and dried up. The [dead vigil]{.tip} can't set in on a corpse while inside the weaver. While in this state the weaver usually will not attack unless provoked.

### The Child-Stealers {.big}
The terror of the villagers in the **Blacksalt** island. They often kidnap babies in the night, turning them into goblins or worse. When angered they will raid villages kidnapping, killing and eating people. They are also called the **forest folk**, **goblinfolk** or just **goblins** in general.

![](./images/goblin.png){.right}

They are usually smaller than humans, with white skin covered in bumps and red spots, pointy ears and usually no hair. They have huge mouths with way too many pointy teeth.

They can't speak properly, their mouths are too wide and has no proper lips, they also lack of any social intelligence, but will say a few broken words. They don't talk to each other much, at least not with words, they will secrete some pheromones that will similar to how ants would. They are mostly guided by their instinct to create more goblins and gremlins from human children and to eat meat, including human meat. They do trade with each other, though, using human teeth as currency.

Goblin nests are rare and extremely well hidden, but tales are told of them. With their rituals they will turn each human into 6 or even more goblins, with livestock they can make at least 8 gremlins. Every goblin nest has at least one **goblin matriarch**, a special shaman that releases the spores that turn humans and animals into goblins.

Child-stealers will roam in the night since they can see in the dark. They avoid sun light but it won't hurt them.

Most of them worship **Igra**, the god of the woods but a few will workship [Goshkalon](blacksalt.html#goshkalon), the god of laughter. They are not evil, but guided to the instinct to reproduce their kind, and the only way to do it is with human children.

![](./images/gremlin.png){.left}

<monster id="gremlin">

*Gremlins are made from captured livestock, like cows or horses. They have wide mouths and are strangely attracted by machinery and will often eat machine parts, which is actually very unhealthy for them.*
*If they manage to eat fresh human meat, they will turn into a **bugbear***

<monster id="bloodshot_goblin">

<monster id="hobgoblin">

<monster id="sack_man">
A big goblin with a sack on his back and a big pole with hook. The sack contains meat for the matriarch and sometimes living captured people or animals.

<monster id="bugbear">

A feral gremlin that ate human flesh, oversized and always hungry. A bugbears are so unstable that event the goblins don't like to have them around.

<monster id="goblin_matriarch">

A very old goblin shaman that has a special fungus growing on her back. Goblins will immobilize their victims and for weeks will force them to breath the spores and eat the fungus, turning them into **goblins** and **gremlins**. Goblins never mourn or feel sad about the death of other goblins, **except** for the death of a matriarch.

No one knows how a goblin matriarch is made.

### Dungeon Scavengers  {.big}
The dungeon ruins have corpses and rotting things all around. While humans avoid those places, they might just be what some creatures are looking for.

### Shore Creatures {.big}

Blacksalt isle shores are full of terrible creatures, some end up venturing deeper into the land and taking refuge in abandoned ruins.

<monster id="giant_leech">

<monster id="giant_frog">

<monster id="giant_crab">

<monster id="golden_ridge_maneater">
A big lizard, looks like a fat toothless alligator. Since it's toothless, it swallow its victims whole, using its immense jaw to crush bones with ease.

Not originally from **Blacksalt**, brought by travellers from the **Golden Ridge**, a few got loose and quickly reproduced, disrupting the ecosystem. They seem to hate humans and will attack on sight, but don't seem to mind the goblinfolk. Goblins quickly took notice of this fact, domesticating and using them as guard dogs.
